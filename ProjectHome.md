Use PeerSim or some other tool to generate graphs of size up to n >= 5000 nodes. Arrange to randomly place copies of 20 files â€“ each file should be placed at 0.1% to 1% of the peers. And run various search algorithms:

  1. using Gnutella-type flooding;
  1. using the random walker model;
  1. using 1-hop replication.

In each case, compute the search time from multiple trials, as well as the total number of nodes visited to locate the object. Then compare the performances of the two search algorithms.
